# Co-project

We had comitted on time, but we didn't merge our files properly and the final file after merge wasn't working. We realised this around 5AM past deadline.
So we had to delete and reupload the files, and merge them properly. It's working fine now, but our commits are late.
Please evaluate our submission, and do not deduct marks for the late submission, if possible.
Our code was ready on time, we just did not upload it to github properly. We realise our mistake and we are sorry about that.
